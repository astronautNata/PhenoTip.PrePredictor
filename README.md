# PhenoTip.PrePredictor
PhenoTip is component that will give predictions of computational weights of each micro model of Huxley model using machine learning techniques.
This repo contains R scripts that will be used as first step before training ML model and predicting. R scripts use different machine learning techniques for preforming feature selection, calculating training set size and finding appropriate machine learning model that will be used in predictions.
